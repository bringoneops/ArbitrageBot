/// Rate limiter using the classic token bucket algorithm.
///
/// # Algorithm
/// Tokens are represented as permits on a [`tokio::sync::Semaphore`]. A
/// background task ticks at a fixed `interval` and replenishes up to
/// `tokens_per_interval` permits, never allowing the bucket to exceed the
/// configured `capacity`.
///
/// # Concurrency
/// Cloning the bucket is cheap because the semaphore is wrapped in an
/// [`Arc`], allowing it to be shared across tasks. Waiting for permits relies on
/// the asynchronous [`Semaphore`] rather than a manual `Mutex`-guarded counter.
/// The semaphore parks tasks until permits become available, avoiding holding a
/// lock across `.await` points and providing fair wakeups. A na√Øve `Mutex` based
/// implementation (see benchmarks) would require custom bookkeeping and
/// sleeping, increasing contention and complexity. Using the semaphore trades a
/// small amount of runtime overhead for a simpler and more robust design.
